# My test file

This is a markdown file with some [urls](https://hachyderm.io/@ma3ke) in it.

Two of them are [broken](https://example.com/this_page_does_not_exist.html).
The others are [fine](https://dwangschematiek.nl/).
Well, for [now](https://twitter.com/), at least.

One more defunct [link](http://example.com/some_more_requests_to_non-existent_pages.html) to top it all off.

Bye :)
